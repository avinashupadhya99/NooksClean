# NooksClean

Code repository for the project Nooks Clean, made for HooHacks 2021.

## Inspiration
The inspiration was to make the earth cleaner.

## What it does
The web app inputs an image from the user and then classifies the image into a category out of 6 for which we have trained the model.

## How we built it
We built it using TensorFlow,  Flask,  HTML, CSS, JS, Flask. The model we are using is VGG16 and the dataset is a Kaggle dataset.

## Challenges we ran into
The first challenge we ran into was using Transfer learning. It was our first time using Transfer Learning and also we were only 2 members in the team.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we completed the project, and were able to run it.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Transfer Learning.

## What's next for Nooks Clean
The next step for Nooks Clean is to add more waste categories and also improve the model used for classifying the waste.
